# LTimeClock
This is my example of the basic features that should be organized in a theme such as "ltime watch". 
In the documentation lies a ready build that you can try out. 
There are also 2 files there - the file called "updates" describes three necessary updates, so that there is a minimally ready version of such a device, which would be quite useful at least as a fan thing. 
If you liked it - I'm glad you did.
